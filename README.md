## What's interesting about the article

The article provides great insight into why
different teams and different programmers
use different programming styles––both on 
the more vane, visual aspect, to the
functional aspect. I found interesting that
it claims that most of the differences are
due to the environment––big company vs small
company––and to the existence of influential
"10x" developers.
